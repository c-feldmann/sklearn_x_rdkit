# sklearn_x_rdkit
A convenience-tool for transforming rdkit fingerprints into sparce matrices. This package will be moved and further maintained in my [compchemkit](https://github.com/c-feldmann/compchemkit), which, at this stage, is  only a work in progress package.

## Installation in Conda
If not already installed, install **pip** and **git**:
```
conda install git
conda install pip
```
Then install via pip:
```
pip install git+git://github.com/c-feldmann/sklearn_x_rdkit
```
